### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Project

### Description
The bikeshare data project analyzes demographic data of bikeshare users in three cities including New York City, Chicago, and Washington. The purpose of the project is to provide decision making insights on who the users are, what time of the day and what particular day of the week the bikes are heavily used, and which station in each of the cities bikes are taken or dropped off.
The model will take you through a series of questions and depending on the data you are looking for, it will filter the variables of interest, and generate useful statistics that you can then use to guide your decision making.
